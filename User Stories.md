As a reader, I want to use the issue-tracker to view a list of issues in an organized manner so that I resolve the issue quickly.

As a writer, I want to use the issue to edit issues so that I can create solutions in the future.

As a coder, I want to use the app to determine how long an issue can be resolved so that I can keep clients updated.
